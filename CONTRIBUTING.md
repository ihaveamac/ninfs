## This is my personal project

I make this project in my free time whenever I feel like it. I make no promises about reading issues or pull requests on a timely basis, or that I will fix certain issues or merge pull requests (soon or ever).

If you are making a significant addition and you intend for it to be implemented in my repository, you should talk to me first, because putting it in my repo means I have to maintain it. Please keep in mind the above paragraph. Maybe keep your own fork if you need something.

## No AI-generated content

Absolutely NO content generated by "artificial intelligence" for **__any reason whatsoever__** (including issues, pull requests, and code). You're wasting my time and yours. If you try to and I find it, I will delete it and likely block you.
